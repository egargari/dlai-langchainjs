    "In the previous lesson, we learned how to construct a chain. Now, we'll go over some techniques to store our own documents for later retrieval to ground the LLM's generation in our own context. This is generally called Retrieval Augmented Generation (or RAG).\n",

    "The basic flow is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load documents from a source.\n",
    "2. Split the docs into chunks small enough to fit into an LLM's context window and avoid distraction.\n",
    "3. Embed the chunks in a vectorstore to allow for later retrieval based on input queries.\n",
    "4. Retrieval of relevant previously-split chunks.\n",
    "5. Generating a final output with retrieved chunks as context.\n",
